"""Configuration for the EcalRecProducer

This file contains the layer weights for the different ecal geometries.
Currently, the v12 layer weights are used.

It is not advised to edit this file, it would be better to copy
the layer weights and second order energy correct to your personal
python configuration file if you want to use a different geometry's parameters.

Examples
--------
>>> from LDMX.Ecal.ecalRecon import ecalRecon
>>> p.sequence.append( ecalRecon )
